# Orbis Tertius

A tool to generate a human-readable data dictionary from the schema of an existing PostgreSQL database. 

`setup.py` installs a Python command-line script `orbis` which probes the `information_schema` views (and a bit from system catalog tables) and generates a Markdown file per table, listing column details and descriptions, primary and foreign key columns, and relationships to and from other tables.

We then use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate a static HTML site from this Markdown content. While Hugo itself must be installed as a prerequisite, a configuration file and [Hugo Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme are included.

## Install and run locally

### Installation

(Assuming macOS and homebrew)

- Clone this repo and `cd` into it
- Create a python virtualenv and install with pip:
  ```sh
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install .
  ```
- Install Hugo with homebrew: `brew install hugo`

### Usage

- Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and edit the `$DATABASE_URL` and `$SCHEMAS` values to suit the desired documentation target database and schemas. `$SCHEMAS` defaults to `public`; you can specify multiple schema names separated by spaces (be sure to surround the whole list with double-quotes) -- see `.env.sample` for an example.
- Command `orbis` invokes script to generate the Markdown, which is saved in `dictionary/content` initially
- Hugo command to create HTML version of the data dictionary docs:
  ```sh
  hugo -s dictionary -d ./public --cleanDestinationDir --minify
  ```

Final Hugo output will be saved to `public` directory and can be served by any static site host.

## Run with docker

- Clone repo and build the Docker image
  ```sh
  git clone [TK]
  cd orbis-tertius
  docker build --rm -t orbis .
- Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and edit the `$DATABASE_URL` and `$SCHEMAS` values to suit the desired documentation target database and schemas. `$SCHEMAS` defaults to `public`; you can specify multiple schema names separated by spaces -- see `.env.sample` for an example. [_Note_: be sure to remember that [Docker is weird about quotation marks in env files](https://dev.to/tvanantwerp/don-t-quote-environment-variables-in-docker-268h)]
- Run the built image, mounting the `public` volume to a local directory and passing `.env` file to the container environment
  ```sh
  docker run -it \
    -v $(pwd)/public:/public \
    --env-file=.env \
    orbis
  ```

Final Hugo output will be saved to `public` directory and can be served by any static site host. The raw Markdown output from `orbis` is included in `public/markdown`.

## Alternative usage

I just wanted to point out that the inclusion of Hugo and the Hugo Book theme here are mainly for convenience/demonstration. Naturally, other themes could be used; if I had more supplementary content to include, I think the [Doks](https://getdoks.org/) theme is quite nice. Customization of any of these themes, or a fully custom theme would of course also be possible.

In fact, the raw Markdown files generated by `orbis` are suitable for use with any of a [variety of static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/), or import into another CMS, including Confluence, etc. One might also use `wkhtmltopdf` or Pandoc against them to generate documentation in PDF or other formats. 

## Orbis what now?

The project name is inspired by the fictional encyclopedia in Jorge Luis Borges's short story, ["Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tl%C3%B6n,_Uqbar,_Orbis_Tertius).
